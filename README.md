# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging a real estate dataset, we analyze key factors such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location to build a predictive model. The repository contains a comprehensive walkthrough of the project, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains step-by-step code for data analysis, model development, and explanations.
- **CSV File**: The dataset used for the analysis.
- **README**: Project overview, dependencies, and instructions to run the project.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for better data understanding.
- Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Machine learning model building and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is kc_house_data.csv, which contains detailed information on houses sold in King County, USA. Each row represents a house with features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.
