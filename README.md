# House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging a real estate dataset, we analyze key factors such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location to build a predictive model. The repository contains a comprehensive walkthrough of the project, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains step-by-step code for data analysis, model development, and explanations.
- **CSV File**: The dataset used for the analysis.
